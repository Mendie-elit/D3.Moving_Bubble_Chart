# D3.Moving_Bubble_Chart

For our 2nd Project of the bootcamp we were tasked to tell a story through data visualizations.  The requirements were as follows:

-Create a Python Task Server
-Use ETL methodolgy to load data into a SQL Database
-Use a non-standard D3 visualization to tell a story

I chose to demonstrate the change in relationship progression over time using D3.js moving bubble chart.
